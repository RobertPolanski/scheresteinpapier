# Technical Development Task for eos.uptrade GmbH

The task is to implement the game Scissors, Stone, Paper (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schere,_Stein,_Papier).

This is a task I got from the company eos.uptrade GmbH to present my skills in clean code.
I could only use pure Java JDK here.
I used such rules as Clean Code (S.O.L.I.D), TDD, DRY etc.


* The implementation of the game: two computer opponents play against each other. 
* At the beginning of the game, it should be possible to select the respective game strategy of the opponents. 
* There should be at least two different game strategies to choose from: Random and Always Stone. 
* It should also be possible to determine the number of games to be played at the beginning. 
* At the end of all game rounds, a summary of the results is given and the game is finished. 
* The rules for the game can be found in the linked Wikipedia article. 
* The game itself should be kept as simple as possible - i.e. all user interactions should take place via text output and input on the command line.
* Your solution should represent the state of professional software development in Java.
